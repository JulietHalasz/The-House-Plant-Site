          <p class="cheesePlant__info">One of the most favoured houseplants, this is called Monstera. A born climber,
            known for outrageous growing potential, so make sure you have enough room for your plant to thrive. Although
            it will enjoy large amounts of sunlight, make sure the plant is never in direct sunlight, as this can burn
            the leaves. Water thoroughly once a week during the warmer months, and then once every 2-3 weeks during the
            cooler winter months. Alow the top 2.5cm of soil to dry before watering. </p>

          <p class="chineseMoneyPlant__info">This plant originated from Southern China and is also known as the Pancake
            Plant. They are partial to a shady spot and grow well on a windowsill in the winter. Do not place them in
            direct sunlight as this can damage their leaves. Water once a week when the soil has completely dried out,
            possibly more during the summer months. </p>

          <p class="succulents__title">Succulents </p>
          <p class="succulents__info"> Succulents love light and need about six hours of sun per day, depending on the
            type of succulent. Rotate them often, so that all sides of the plant are getting an even amount of sunlight.
            When the first inch of soil is dry, water your succulents. This will be a lot more frequently in the summer,
            but make sure you let the soil dry between waterings. Keep succulents clean and wipe away dust with a cloth.
