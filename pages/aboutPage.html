                    <p> We’re a group of people with green thumbs and green minds. Beginning as a group task for the
                        Introduction to Web Development Course by Code First Girls and Service Now, The House Plant Site
                        quickly bloomed into a passion project. You won’t be-leaf the time we spent propagating this
                        website, and we’re thrilled to finally be able to share it with you.</p>
                    <p>At its roots, The House Plant Site is designed to act as a space where fellow enthusiasts can
                        learn more about their plants - and maybe even discover their next one!</p>

                                    <p>Alana is a coder and UX designer. Her experience and interests vary widely: from
                                        website design, to illustration, animation, and even creating her own Instagram
                                        filter.</p>
                                    <p>Alana has found keeping plants in the home a fun way to instantly brighten up a
                                        space, and can even make you feel more settled after a big move! Her favourite
                                        plant is a Bird of Paradise, because it's the most exotic and beautiful plant
                                        you can own.</p>
